            My name is <span style={{ color: "orange" }}>Fizza Zeeshan</span>, 
            I am a person with a strong interest in software development, particularly web development. My objectives are to advance my professional career by refining my web
            development abilities. I've always been intrigued by software innovation and design. Working creatively to solve complex problems and learning how people interact with designed systems and services is a lot of fun. I've done some group projects at university and an internship, and I loved being on a journey with amazing people, creating new things by pushing the boundaries.
            <br></br>
            Apart from that, I enjoy baking. I bake for fun and find it therapeutic. I actually run a small home-based business. I am a co-founder and manager of a business called MiniTreats.
